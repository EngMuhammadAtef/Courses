        <h2>Why Use Java?        </h2>
        <p>
            Java works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc.)
            <br>
            Java is one of the most popular programming language in the world
            <br>
            Java is easy to learn and simple to use
            <br>
            Java is open-source and free.
            <br>
            Java is secure, fast and powerful.
            <br>
            Java is an object oriented language which gives a clear structure to programs and allows code to be reused, lowering development costs
        </p>

        <h3>Java Syntax        </h3>
        <p>
            we created a Java file called Main.java, and we used the following code to print "Hello World" to the screen:
            <br>
            <br>
            public class Main {
            <br>
            public static void main(String[] args) {
                System.out.println("Hello World");
            }
        }
        >> Hello World

        </p>
        <div class="line"></div>

        <a name="Variables"></a>

        <h2> Java Variables
        </h2>
        <p>
            Variables are containers for storing data values.
            A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.
        </p>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <h2> Example </h2>
        <p>
            int x = 5;
            <br>
            String name = "John";
            <br>
            System.out.println(x);
            <br>
            System.out.println(name);
            <br>
            <br>
            >> 5
            <br>
            >> John
            <br>
            <br>
        </p>

        <div class="line"></div>
        <a name="DataTypes"></a>
        <h2> Java Data Types
        </h2>
        <p>
            In programming, data type is an important concept.
            <br>
            Variables can store data of different types, and different types can do different things.
            <br>
            As explained in the previous chapter, a variable in Java must be a specified data type:

        <div class="line"></div>
        Text Type :===>>> str # String myText = "Hello";
        <br>
        Int Type :===>>>> int # int myNum = 5;
        <br>
        Float Types :===>>>	float # float myFloatNum = 5.99f;
        <br>
        Char Types :===>>> char # char myLetter = 'D';
        <br>
        Boolean Type :===>>> bool # boolean myBool = true;
        </p>

        <div class="line"></div>
        <a name="If-Else"></a>
        <h2> Java Conditions and If statements        </h2>
        <p>
            Java supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics:
            <br>
            Equals: a == b
            <br>
            Not Equals: a != b
            <br>
            Less than: a < b
            <br>
            Less than or equal to: a <= b
            <br>
            Greater than: a > b
            <br>
            Greater than or equal to: a >= b
        </p>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <h2> Example </h2>
        <p>
            int a = 10;   
            <br>
            int b = 5;
            <br>
            if (b > a) {System.out.println("b is greater than a")}
            <br>
            else if (a == b) {System.out.println("a and b are equal")}
            <br>
            else {System.out.println("a is greater than b")}
            <br>
            <br>
            >> a is greater than b
        </p>





        <div class="line"></div>
        <a name="WhileLoops"></a>
        <h2> Java While Loop</h2>
        <p>
            Loops can execute a block of code as long as a specified condition is reached.
            <br>
            Loops are handy because they save time, reduce errors, and they make code more readable.
            <br>
            The while loop loops through a block of code as long as a specified condition is true:
        </p>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <h2> Example </h2>
        <p>
            // Print i as long as i is less than 5:
            <br>
            int i = 1;
            <br>

            while (i < 5) {
            <br>
              System.out.println(i);
              <br>
              i++;
              <br>
            }
            <br>
            <br>
            >> 1
            <br>
            >> 2
            <br>
            >> 3
            <br>
            >> 4
        </p>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <a name="ForLoops"></a>
        <h2> Java For Loop        </h2>
        <p>
            When you know exactly how many times you want to loop through a block of code, use the for loop instead of a while loop:
        </p>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <h2> Example </h2>
        <p>
            for (int i = 1; i < 5; i++) {
            <br>
            System.out.println(i);}
            <br>
            <br>
            >> 1
            <br>
            >> 2
            <br>
            >> 3
            <br>
            >> 4
        </p>      
        <div class="line"></div>
        <a name="Functions"></a>
        <h2> Java Methods        </h2>
        <p>
            A Method is a block of code which only runs when it is called.
            <br>
            You can pass data, known as parameters, into a method.
            <br>
            Methods are used to perform certain actions, and they are also known as functions.
            <br>
            Why use methods? To reuse code: define the code once, and use it many times.
        </p>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <h2> Create a Method        </h2>
        <p>
            public class Main {
                <br>
                static void myMethod() {
                <br>
                  System.out.println("I just got executed!");}
                <br>
                public static void main(String[] args) {
                <br>
                  myMethod();}
                <br>
              }
            <br>
            <br>
            >> I just got executed!
        </p>

        <a name="Arrays"></a>
        <h2> Java Arrays        </h2>
        <p>
            Arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable, instead of declaring separate variables for each value.
            <br>
            To declare an array, define the variable type with square brackets:
        <div class="line"></div>
        <h2> Example </h2>
        <p>
            // Create an array containing car names:
            <br>
            String[] cars = {"Volvo", "BMW", "Ford", "Mazda"};
            <br>
            <h4>Access the Elements of an Array            </h4> 
            <br>
            // You access an array element by referring to the index number.
            <br>
            String[] cars = {"Volvo", "BMW", "Ford", "Mazda"};
            <br>
            System.out.println(cars[0]);
            <br>
            <br>
            >> Volvo
            <br>
            <br>
            <h4>Modify the value of the first array item:</h4> 
            <br>
            cars[0] = "Opel";
            <br>
            System.out.println(cars);
            <br>
            <br>
            >> {"Opel", "BMW", "Ford", "Mazda"}
        </p>
